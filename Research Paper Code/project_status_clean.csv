Consistent with other step street projects, the design consultant for this project shall provide several design alternatives for the project limits, with attention paid to maximizing accessibility, public space, functionality, and streetscape amenities (street trees, seating, etc.) within the right of way. DOT acknowledges that many of these priorities are competing for limited space within this constrained project site, and that the different alternatives will prioritize these competing interests differently.DOT’s preliminary accessibility analysis suggests that a combination of ADA accessible ramps and staircases are feasible within the project limits (see this document’s conceptual design attachment for a proof of concept). This scale diagram establishes that there is sufficient space for a ramp structure within the project limits. DDC shall direct the design consultant to explore various ramp and stair configurations during preliminary design and identify any technical challenges associated with their construction. If, after reviewing the design alternatives, it is determined only stairway accessibility can be provided, any technical infeasibility or other constraint that limits building to full ADA requirements must be fully documented and added to the project file. The documentation must, at a minimum, clearly lay out the issue, describe the efforts taken to rectify the issue, and explain why the final design was chosen to be selected.",RECONSTRUCTION OF STEP STREETS,Design,0,PROJECT DELAYED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS,RECONSTRUCTION OF THE E 169TH STREET STEP STREET,High Risk,Roof Work,Funding/Financial Issues,Transportation
